## Required Software Checklist ‚úÖ

Before attending SSoQE 2025, please ensure you have the following software installed:

- [ ] **R** (verze 4.5+)
- [ ] **RStudio** (aktu√°ln√≠ verze)
- [ ] **Rtools** (pro Windows)
- [ ] **Git** (pro ≈ô√≠zen√≠ verz√≠)
- [ ] **GitHub account** (zdarma)

## R and RStudio üíª

- [R](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/R_(programming_language)) is a fantastic software for statistical analyses.
- üìä [RStudio](https://posit.co/products/open-source/rstudio/) is your trusty sidekick, helping you navigate the R universe with ease.

### Install/Update R

Make sure you have **R version 4.5 or later** installed. You can:

- Download the latest version from [CRAN](https://cran.r-project.org/)
- Check your current version by running `R.version.string` in R Console

```r
R.version.string
# [1] "R version 4.5.1 (2025-06-13 ucrt)"
```

### Install/Update RStudio

Download and install the **latest version** of RStudio from the [RStudio website](https://rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/).

You can check your RStudio version by running:

```r
rstudioapi::versionInfo()$version
# [1] ‚Äò2025.5.1.513‚Äô
```

### Rtools (Windows Users Only) ü™ü

If you're using Windows, you'll need **Rtools** for building R packages. Download the version compatible with your R version from the [CRAN Rtools page](https://cran.r-project.org/bin/windows/Rtools/).

For R 4.5+, use Rtools 4.5 etc.

### Additional Resources

There are plenty of additional guides available to help you:

-   [R Basics for Paleoecologists](https://ckiahtipes.github.io/) by C.A. Kiahtipes
-   [Install or Update R tutorial](https://jennhuck.github.io/workshops/install_update_R.html) by Jennifer Huck

## Python and Python packages üêç
First, check if Python is installed on your computer by opening the **terminal** and running `python --version`. If nothing is displayed or the version is <3.12, download and install the **latest version** of Python from the [Python website](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

Then, install the **required Python packages** using pip:  
1. Open the **terminal** of either RStudio or your computer.  
2. Install **pytorch** for building deep learning models by running the following command `pip3 install torch torchvision --index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cu126`  
3. Install **torchvision** for visualising deep learning models by running the following command `pip3 install torchinfo`  
4. Install **matplotlib** for creating plots by running the following command `pip3 install matplotlib`  
5. Install **numpy** for mathematical operations by running the following command `pip3 install numpy`  
6. Install **pandas** for handling data frames by running the following command `pip3 install pandas`  

You can leave Python by running `exit()`.    

‚ö†Ô∏èIf pip wasn't installed with Python, follow the instructions on how to install pip [here](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/installation-guide/how-to-install-pip-on-windows/).  

## Git and GitHub üåê

Please follow the tutorial [here](https://ondrejmottl.github.io/VersionControl_gitHell/) to install Git and set up a GitHub account.

Specifically, we will be using Git, GitHub, and RStudio for version control and collaboration during the workshop.
ü§ù

### Quick setup checklist

1. **Install Git** - Download from [git-scm.com](https://git-scm.com/)
2. **Create GitHub account** - Sign up at [github.com](https://github.com/)
3. **Configure Git** with your name and email:
   ```bash
   git config --global user.name "Your Name"
   git config --global user.email "your.email@example.com"
   ```
4. **Set up authentication** - We'll help you with Personal Access Tokens (PAT) during the workshop

## Packages üì¶

Packages are like magic toolboxes üß∞ that contain a collection of functions for specific needs.
We want to make sure that everyone has the necessary packages installed for this workshop.

### Essential packages for SSoQE 2025

Let's create a list of the core packages we'll need from CRAN:

```{r}
#| label: chunk-pkg-list
#| output: false
#| warning: false
#| message: false
# Complete list of R packages used across SSoQE lectures
# Generated on September 11, 2025
ssoqe_package_list <-
  c(
    # Project management & Environment
    "here",
    "remotes",
    "renv",
    "usethis",

    # Data manipulation & Analysis
    "janitor",
    "rlang",
    "tidyverse",

    # Visualization & Graphics
    "showtext",
    "sysfonts",

    # File & Data management
    "fs",
    "jsonlite",
    "rjson",

    # Document generation & Reporting
    "knitr",
    "pander",
    "quarto",
    "tinytable",

    # Regression & Statistical Modelling
    "lme4",

    # Spatial & Geographic analyses
    "geojsonsf",
    "terra",
    "sdm",

    # Paleoecological/Scientific packages

    "countdown",
    "qrcode",

    # Python integration
    "png",
    "RcppTOML",
    "reticulate"
  )
```

### Test if all packages are ready ‚úÖ

Let's do a quick test to make sure everything is in order.
Running the following code should produce `"Everything is good to go!"` instead of an error message.

```{r}
#| label: chunk-pkg-test
#| eval: false
missing_packages <-
  installed.packages() |>
  rownames() |>
  setdiff(x = ssoqe_package_list)

if (
  length(missing_packages) == 0
) {
  cat("Everything is good to go!")
} else {
  paste(
    "The following packages are not installed: \n\n",
    missing_packages |>
      paste(collapse = ", "),
    "\n\nPlease install them before the workshop."
  ) |>
    warning()
}
```

Now, let's install all the missing packages:

```{r}
#| label: chunk-pkg-install
#| eval: false
# Install packages one by one with error handling
for (pkg in missing_packages) {
  if (!require(pkg, character.only = TRUE, quietly = TRUE)) {
    install.packages(pkg)
  }
}
```

### Test if RStudio has successfully connected with Python ‚úÖ

Run the following code chunk in R:

```{r}
#| output: false
#| warning: false
#| message: false
#| eval: false
    library(reticulate)
```
If you receive an error/warning message because **{reticulate} cannot find** your Python programme,

1. Open the **terminal** and run the command `python -c "import sys; print(sys.version); print(sys.executable)"` to get the path of your current python version.

2. Plug in the path to your python version in the following **R** code chunk and run it.

```{r}
#| output: false
#| warning: false
#| message: false
#| eval: false
reticulate::use_python(PATH/TO/PYTHON) #Enter the correct path to your python version
```
Now you should be ready to run Python and train deep learning models in RStudio using Markdown files! üéâ
